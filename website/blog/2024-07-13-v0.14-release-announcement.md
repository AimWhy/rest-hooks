- [#3115](https://github.com/reactive/data-client/pull/3115) [`34f12c4`](https://github.com/reactive/data-client/commit/34f12c4022462bea441ec134a61cfcc4cf505e6d) Thanks [@ntucker](https://github.com/ntucker)! - Add [useLoading()](https://dataclient.io/docs/api/useLoading), [useDebounce()](https://dataclient.io/docs/api/useDebounce), [useCancelling()](https://dataclient.io/docs/api/useCancelling)


- [#3146](https://github.com/reactive/data-client/pull/3146) [`6325384`](https://github.com/reactive/data-client/commit/632538421bf21440a12bb32cb3c8cccd3a5c4cbb) Thanks [@ntucker](https://github.com/ntucker)! - Call fetches immediately - do not wait for idle

  [NetworkManager](https://dataclient.io/docs/api/NetworkManager) will fetch
  immediately, rather than waiting for idle. With React 18+ it is expected for
  React to better handle work with concurrent mode and batching. Due to this, it
  is not longer deemed the best performance to wait for idle and instead we should
  fetch immediately.

  `IdlingNetworkManager` is still available to keep the previous behavior.


- [#3141](https://github.com/reactive/data-client/pull/3141) [`d225595`](https://github.com/reactive/data-client/commit/d2255959489b71cfdfcaf4be72fd272231d392f1) Thanks [@ntucker](https://github.com/ntucker)! - BREAKING CHANGE: setResponseAction.payload -> setResponseAction.response

  This only affects those writing custom [Managers](https://dataclient.io/docs/concepts/managers) that
  inspect `SET_RESPONSE_TYPE` `action.payload`.

  #### Before

  ```ts
  import {
    SET_RESPONSE_TYPE,
    type Manager,
    type Middleware,
  } from '@data-client/react';

  export default class MyManager implements Manager {
    getMiddleware = (): Middleware => controller => next => async action => {
      switch (action.type) {
        case SET_RESPONSE_TYPE:
          console.log('Resolved with value', action.payload);
          return next(action);
        default:
          return next(action);
      }
    };

    cleanup() {}
  }
  ```

  #### After

  ```ts
  import {
    SET_RESPONSE_TYPE,
    type Manager,
    type Middleware,
  } from '@data-client/react';

  export default class MyManager implements Manager {
    getMiddleware = (): Middleware => controller => next => async action => {
      switch (action.type) {
        case SET_RESPONSE_TYPE:
          console.log('Resolved with value', action.response);
          return next(action);
        default:
          return next(action);
      }
    };

    cleanup() {}
  }
  ```

- [#3134](https://github.com/reactive/data-client/pull/3134) [`2ad1811`](https://github.com/reactive/data-client/commit/2ad1811149cdc419f6462ace08efdb7766195b36) Thanks [@ntucker](https://github.com/ntucker)! - Change Schema.normalize `visit()` interface; removing non-contextual arguments.

  ```ts
  /** Visits next data + schema while recurisvely normalizing */
  export interface Visit {
    (schema: any, value: any, parent: any, key: any, args: readonly any[]): any;
    creating?: boolean;
  }
  ```

  This results in a 10% normalize performance boost.

  ```ts title="Before"
  processedEntity[key] = visit(
    processedEntity[key],
    processedEntity,
    key,
    this.schema[key],
    addEntity,
    visitedEntities,
    storeEntities,
    args,
  );
  ```

  ```ts title="After"
  processedEntity[key] = visit(
    this.schema[key],
    processedEntity[key],
    processedEntity,
    key,
    args,
  );
  ```

  The information needed from these arguments are provided by [closing](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)>) `visit()` around them.

  This only affects those writing custom [Managers](https://dataclient.io/docs/concepts/managers) that
  inspect `FETCH_TYPE` `action.fetch`.

  #### Before

  ```ts
  import {
    FETCH_TYPE,
    type Manager,
    type Middleware,
  } from '@data-client/react';

  export default class MyManager implements Manager {
    getMiddleware = (): Middleware => controller => next => async action => {
      switch (action.type) {
        case FETCH_TYPE:
          // consume fetch, and print the resolution
          action.fetch().then(response => console.log(response));
        default:
          return next(action);
      }
    };

    cleanup() {}
  }
  ```

  #### After

  ```ts
  import {
    FETCH_TYPE,
    type Manager,
    type Middleware,
  } from '@data-client/react';

  export default class MyManager implements Manager {
    getMiddleware = (): Middleware => controller => next => async action => {
      switch (action.type) {
        case FETCH_TYPE:
          // consume fetch, and print the resolution
          action
            .endpoint(...action.meta.args)
            .fetch()
            .then(response => console.log(response));
        default:
          return next(action);
      }
    };

    cleanup() {}
  }

  ```ts
  interface SchemaSimple {
    normalize(
      input: any,
      parent: any,
      key: any,
      args: any[],
      visit: (
        schema: any,
        value: any,
        parent: any,
        key: any,
        args: readonly any[],
      ) => any,
      addEntity: (...args: any) => any,
      getEntity: (...args: any) => any,
      checkLoop: (...args: any) => any,
    ): any;
  }
  ```

  We also add `checkLoop()`, which moves some logic in [Entity](https://dataclient.io/rest/api/Entity)
  to the core normalize algorithm.

  ```ts
  /** Returns true if a circular reference is found */
  export interface CheckLoop {
    (entityKey: string, pk: string, input: object): boolean;
  }
  ```

  ```ts
  interface SchemaSimple {
    denormalize(
      input: {},
      args: readonly any[],
      unvisit: (schema: any, input: any) => any,
    ): T;
  }
  ```
